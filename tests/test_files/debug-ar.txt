material is raw cotton, an agricultural produce, and as such there are no social or environmental concerns or risks involved. Raw 
cotton is widely available, in a sustainable manner, both from domestic and imported. There is no requirement of water for 
manufacture of cotton yarn. The energy needs are addressed by installation of windmills, renewable and clean energy. 
Continuous and consistent efforts are made to optimise the resources throughout the entire production process. The upstream 
manufacturing of products out of cotton yarn would require minimum resources depending upon the production activities 
carried out by the customers.

Operations of the Company manufacturing Cotton Yarn and Knitted Fabrics, prima facie, falls under Orange category duly 
certified by Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board. In addition, the Company has installed windmills for captive consumption 
and generates power towards clean development mechanism for reduction of Co   and to that extent contributes reduction of

**DIRECTORS’ REPORT (Contd...) AMBIKA COTTON MILLS LIMITED**

The Company’s key area of strategic focus is on customer satisfaction, and attracting new customers through commitment to 
production of high quality products which serves as a strong base in this regard.

The Company imports raw cotton from reputed farmers/intermediaries from USA/EGYPT/Australia and carries strong 
goodwill among them in terms of honouring such contracts without re-negotiating even under adverse circumstances such as 
COVID-19, the pandemic and on the other hand accepted requests from Company’s buyers for deferment of deliveries to suit 
their convenience. 

The Company’s track record of product innovation, consistency in quality and timely delivery of committed orders has 
substantially contributed to repeat orders and its overall financial performance. 

The Company's Total Revenue and Gross profit amounted to Rs. 86134.97 Lakhs (Previous year Rs. 92547.98 Lakhs) and Rs. 
18229.94 Lakhs (Previous year Rs. 27337.80 Lakhs). This represents decline of 6.93 % in total Revenue as compared to 46.04 % 
growth in the previous year and decline of 33.32% in Gross Profit as against growth of 129.10% in the previous year.

For the year Company's Direct & SEZ Export  Turnover under USD amounted to Rs. 59802.38 Lakhs as compared to Rs. 62651.43 
Lakhs in the previous year representing decline  of 4.55% (Previous Year growth  of 41.08%)

In terms of percentage Exports Turnover constituted 73.20% of the total turnover as against 71.25% in the previous year.

During the year the Company has invested Rs.1780.14 Lakhs, out of internal accruals, in Factory Building and Plant & 
Machinery

Manufacturing Plants located at Dindigul in the State of Tamil Nadu for captive consumption at an estimated cost of Rs. 39.08 
Crores, to be met out of internal accruals, in respect of which application has duly been submitted to the State Government of 
Tamil Nadu. The project would generate 1.157 Crore units annually on its completion and the company plans to complete before 
February 2024.

performance despite demand slowdown for cotton yarn which is expected to turn around during the current year.

hand-spun and hand woven textiles sectors at one end of the spectrum, while the capital intensive sophisticated mills sector at 

the other end of the spectrum.

The decentralised power looms/ hosiery and knitting sector form the largest component of the textiles sector. The close linkage 

of the textile industry to agriculture (for raw materials such as cotton) and the ancient culture and traditions of the country in 

terms of textiles make the Indian textiles sector unique in comparison to the industries of other countries. The Indian textile 

industry has the capacity to produce a wide variety of products suitable to different market segments, both within India and 

across the world. The textiles industry is also labour intensive and employs large number of persons.

The fundamental strength of the textile industry in India is its strong production base of wide range of fibre/yarns from natural 

fibres like cotton, jute, silk and wool to synthetic /man-made fibres like polyester, viscose, nylon and acrylic.

Our country's connection with the textile sector dates back centuries. Every State in India has some unique textiles to offer. For 

instance, if the hand-painted cotton textile, Kalamkari is native to Andhra Pradesh, Ilkalsarees are Karnataka's indigenous 

textile. While Odisha is home to Sambalpuri fabric, Phulakri's are the pride of Punjab's culture. The vibrant, world-renowned 

Indian textiles have captivated several fabric connoisseurs and are highly valued globally. In human history, the importance of 

textiles cannot be sidelined, as they have changed social scenarios. 

Evidence that inhabitants in the Harappan civilization were deft at spinning and weaving has been uncovered. William Lee 

created the stocking frame, the first hand-operated weft knitting machine, The textile evolution took a stride forward during the 

mediaeval age with  William Lee's creation, the stocking frame. It was the first hand-operated weft knitting machine.

It was in the early nineteenth century that the textile industry started to gain momentum. This era saw the establishment of the 

first textile mill at fort Gloster, Kolkata in 1818 and in 1854 a cotton textile mill in Bombay. In 1861, the textile industry expanded 

its horizons to include Ahmedabad. In the second half of the nineteenth century, the cotton textile industry saw rapid progress.

The real technology-enabled revolution started to unfold in the industrial age. One such machine that was a game changer in the 

textile industry was the water frame, invented by the doyen of the textile segment, Sir Richard Arkwright. This invention 

facilitated faster spinning of cotton yarn. In addition to cotton, Indian silks were exported along the Silk Road in China and later 

on to western nations, making them another significant export of the ancient Indian textile industry. The British Empire 

colonised India for various reasons, but one of the main ones was the country's cheap, high-quality cotton. 

The Indian textile industry has been ever-growing and is immensely influenced by tradition and aesthetics. A great stimulus for 

the Indian textile and cotton industries stemmed from the two world wars and the Swadeshi movement in India. Indian 

handlooms, spinning, and weaving techniques have been celebrated for centuries. Also, it has gradually and steadily created a 

niche for itself in home textile products in domestic and international markets.

During the Swaraj movement, Mahatma Gandhi encouraged people to use a spinning wheel, to make their own cloth. Khadi 

became a symbol of independence and self-sufficiency. As the Swaraj movement gained traction, the British Empire lost its hold 

on the textile industry This remarkable event changed the entire course of our Indian textiles, leading to a complete 

reorganisation of the industry.

**2. Market Size**

 The Indian textile industry is set for strong growth, buoyed by both strong domestic consumption as well as export demand. The 

sector is expected to reach US$ 226 billion by FY 2023. Urbanization is expected to support higher growth due to change in 

fashion and trends. This is amplified by opening of exclusive stores by the leading brands across the country. At present, our 

textile industry is estimated at $16 billion, approximately 6% of the global market. India is among the top 5 apparel and textile 

exporting countries in the world. 

For textile industry, the proposed hike in FDI limit in multi-brand retail will bring in more players, thereby providing more 

options to consumers. It will also bring in greater investments along the entire value chain – from agricultural production to final 

manufacture of goods. With global retail brands assured of a domestic foothold, outsourcing will also rise significantly.  

**AMBIKA COTTON MILLS LIMITED ADDITIONAL DISCLOSURES PURSUANT TO REGULATIONS  (Contd...)**

**3. Opportunities & Threats**

Cotton yarn accounts for the largest share in total yarn production; India's growing population has been a key driver of textile 
consumption growth in the country. It has been complemented by a young population which is growing and at the same time is 
exposed to changing tastes and fashion. Rising income has been a key determinant of domestic demand for the sector; with 
income rising in the rural economy as well, the upward push on demand from the income side is set to continue.

Complementing this factor is rising female workforce participation in the Country. With consumerism and disposable income 
on the rise, the retail sector is set to experience a rapid growth. The organized apparel segment is expected to grow at a 
compound annual growth rate of more than 13% over a ten year period.   

According to the new draft of the National Textile Policy, the Government is planning to attract foreign investments thereby 
creating employment opportunities to 35 million people. 

Tech-enabled solutions will empower us to become the world's new textile and apparel production hub. Solutions that are 
scalable and also ecologically viable are imperative for the Indian textile industry. Changes in supply chain management, 
innovative fibres, smart farming to amplify natural fibre farming, and recycled yarn productions are some of the aspects that 
will help us build core competencies to become the global leader of the textile industry.

**Embracing 3D technology**

The adoption of 3D technology will make product creation more straightforward than ever. 3D rendering will assist in figuring 
out the ideal fit for costumes.

**Blockchain for effective execution**

Blockchain will have a profound impact on the way the textile industry interacts and executes transactions. Apart from bringing 
transparency to the transactions, blockchain will assist in tracking pertinent data points that will benefit stakeholders in the 
textile supply chain. 

**High-quality fabrics**

While we work towards capturing a major share in the global textile market, means and methods to ensure the production and 
use of premium natural fabrics are vital.

**Optimisation through digitization**

 By bringing accurate data and processes together under one unified platform, the textile supply chain can be digitised thus 
paving the way to produce and craft more products

**INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT AMBIKA COTTON MILLS LIMITED**

**To the Members of Ambika Cotton Mills Limited   Report on the Financial Statements**

**Opinion**

We have audited the Financial Statements of Ambika Cotton Mills Limited(“the Company”), which comprise the 

Balance Sheet as at 31st March 2023, the Statement of Profit and Loss (including Other Comprehensive Income), the 

Statement of Changes in Equity and Statement of Cash Flows for the year then ended and notes to the financial 

statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information. 

In our opinion and to the best of our information and according to the explanations given to us, the aforesaid 

Financial Statements give the information required by the Companies Act,2013 (“the Act”)  in the manner so 

required and give a true and fair view in conformity with the Indian Accounting Standards prescribed under 

section 133 of the Act read with the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015, as amended, (“Ind AS”) 

and other accounting principles generally accepted in India, of the state of affairs of the Company as at March 31, 

2023, the Profit and total comprehensive income, changes in equity and its cash flows for the year ended on that 

date.

**Basis for Opinion**

 We conducted our audit in accordance with the Standards on Auditing (SAs) specified under section 143(10) of the 

Act. Our responsibilities under those Standards are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit 

of the Financial Statements section of our report. We are independent of the Company in accordance with the Code 

of Ethics issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India together with the ethical requirements that are 

relevant to our audit of the financial statements under the provisions of the Act and the Rules thereunder, and we 

have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements and the Code of Ethics. We 

believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. 

**Key Audit Matters**

Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the 

financial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial 

statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these 

matters

55

**INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT AMBIKA COTTON MILLS LIMITED**

**Information Other than the Financial Statements and Auditor’s Report There on**

The Company’s Board of Directors is responsible for the preparation of the other information. The other information comprises 

the information included in the Management Discussion and Analysis, Board’s Report including Annexures to Board’s Report, 

Business Responsibility and Sustainability Report, Corporate Governance and Shareholder’s Information, but does not include 

the Financial Statements and our auditor’s report thereon. 

Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of assurance 

conclusion thereon.

 In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, 

consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the 

audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.

 If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are 

required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.

**Responsibilities of Management and Those Charged with Governance for the Financial Statements**

The Company’s Board of Directors is responsible for the matters stated in section 134(5) of the Act with respect to the preparation 

of these Financial Statements that give a true and fair view of the financial position, financial performance, total comprehensive 

income changes in equity and cash flows of the Company in accordance with the Ind AS and other accounting principles 

generally accepted in India. This responsibility also includes maintenance of adequate accounting records in accordance with 

the provisions of the Act for safeguarding  the assets of the Company and for preventing and detecting frauds and other 

irregularities; selection and application of appropriate accounting policies; making judgments and estimates that are reasonable 

and prudent; and design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls, that were operating 

effectively for ensuring the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, relevant to the preparation and presentation 

of the financial statements that give a true and fair view and are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

 In preparing the financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Company’s ability to continue as a going 

concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless 

management either intends to liquidate the Company or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.

The Board of Directors are also responsible for overseeing the Company’s financial reporting process. 

**Key Audit Matter How our audit addressed the key audit matter**

The Company has uncertain tax positions on 

matters under dispute which involve significant 

judgment to determine the possible outcome of 

these disputes.

Refer Note 30.1 to the Financial statements.

**Evaluation of open tax litigations (Direct and Indirect tax)**

• Obtained details of completed tax assessments and demands
 
as on March 31,2023 from the management.

• Obtained an understanding of key uncertain tax positions.

• Discussed with appropriate senior management and assessed
 
management’s estimate of the possible outcome of the

 
disputed cases.  

**INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT AMBIKA COTTON MILLS LIMITED**

**Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements**

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material 

misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is 

a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with SAs will always detect a material 

misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in 

aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial 

statements.

As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout 

the audit. We also:

•  Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and

 
perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a 

 
basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting

 
from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal

 
control. 

•  Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in

 
the circumstances. Under section 143(3)(i) of the  Act, we are also responsible for expressing our opinion on whether the

 
company has adequate internal financial controls system in place and the operating effectiveness of such controls.

•  Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related

 
disclosures made by management.

•  Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit

 
evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on

 
the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to

 
draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are

 
inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s

 
report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern. 

• 
Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether

 
the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation. 

 
Materiality is the magnitude of misstatements in the Financial Statements that, individually or in aggregate makes it

 
probable that the economic decisions of a reasonably knowledgeable user of the financial statements may be influenced. We

 
 consider quantitative materiality and qualitative factors in (i) planning the scope of our audit work and in evaluating the

 
 results of our work; and  (ii) to evaluate the effect of any identified misstatements in the financial statements.

 
We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the

 
audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our

 
audit. 

**INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT AMBIKA COTTON MILLS LIMITED**

 
We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical

 
requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may

 
reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards. 

 
From the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of most

 
significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We

 
describe these matters in our auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or

 
when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the

 
adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such

 
communication.

**Report on the Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting under Clause (i) of Sub-section 3  of Section 143 of the Companies Act, 2013 (“the Act”)**

We have audited the internal financial controls over financial reporting of Ambika Cotton Mills Limited (“the Company”) as of 

March 31, 2023 in conjunction with our audit of the Financial Statements of the Company for the year ended on that date.

**Management’s Responsibility for Internal Financial Controls**

The Board of Directors of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining Internal financial controls based on the 

internal control over financial reporting criteria established by the Company considering the essential components of internal 

control stated in the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting issued by the Institute of 

Chartered Accountants of India. These responsibilities include the design, implementation and maintenance of adequate 

internal financial controls that were operating effectively for ensuring the orderly and efficient conduct of its business, including 

adherence to respective company’s policies, the safeguarding of its assets, the prevention and detection of frauds and errors, the 

accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, and the timely preparation of reliable financial information, as required 

under the Companies Act, 2013

**Auditor’s Responsibility**

Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the internal financial controls over financial reporting of the Company based on 

our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial 

Reporting (the “Guidance Note”) issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India and the Standards on Auditing 

prescribed under Section 143(10) of the Companies Act, 2013, to the extent applicable to an audit of internal financial controls. 

Those Standards and the Guidance Note require that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to 

obtain reasonable assurance about whether adequate internal financial controls over financial reporting was established and 

maintained and if such controls operated effectively in all material respects.

Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the adequacy of the internal financial controls system 

over financial reporting and their operating effectiveness. Our audit of internal financial controls over financial reporting 

included obtaining an understanding of internal financial controls over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material 

weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.

 The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the 

financial statements, whether due to fraud or error.

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained, is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the 

internal financial controls system over financial reporting of the Company.

**ANNEXURE “A” TO THE INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT AMBIKA COTTON MILLS LIMITED**

(Referred to in Paragraph 1(f) of Report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements)

**Meaning of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting**

A company’s internal financial control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding 

the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with 

generally accepted accounting principles.

 A company’s internal financial control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that

 
(1) Pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and  

 
 
 dispositions of the assets of the company;

 
(2) Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial

 
 
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the

 
 
company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and 

 
(3)  Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or

 
 
disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

**Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial Controls over Financial Reporting**

Because of the inherent limitations of internal financial controls over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or 

improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. Also, 

projections of any evaluation of the internal financial controls over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk 

that the internal financial control over financial reporting may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the 

degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate

**Opinion**

In our opinion, to the best of our information and according to the explanations given to us, the Company has, in all material 

respects, an adequate internal financial controls system over financial reporting and such internal financial controls over 

financial reporting were operating effectively as at March 31, 2023, based on the internal control over financial reporting criteria 

established by the Company considering the essential components of internal control stated in the Guidance Note on Audit of 

Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India.

**2.SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES**

**2.1.Statement of compliance**

The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IND AS notified under Section. 133 of the Companies Act, 2013 read with the 

Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) (IndAS) Rules 2015 and other relevant provisions of the Act. 

**2.2.Basis of preparation and presentation**

These financial statements are prepared in accordance with Indian Accounting Standards (IndAS) under the historical cost convention on the 

accrual basis except for certain financial instruments which are measured at fair values, the provisions of the Companies Act, 2013(`Act')(to the 

extent notified) and guidelines issued by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI). The Ind AS are prescribed under Section 133 of the 

Act read with Rule 3 of the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) (IndAS)  Rules, 2015 and The Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) 

(Amendment) Rules, 2016.

**2.3. Property, Plant and Equipment**

Property, plant and equipment are carried at cost of acquisition including any attributable cost of bringing the assets to its working condition for 

its intended use and net of Cenvat /GST or any other claim receivable less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses , if any.  

The depreciation charge is based on useful life and the expected residual value at the end of its life and are determined by management at the 

time the asset is acquired and reviewed periodically, including at each financial year end with the effect of any changes in estimate accounted for 

on a prospective basis. The lives are based on historical experience with similar assets as well as anticipation of future events, which may impact 

their life, such as changes in technology.

**Depreciation is recognised using the straight-line method.**

An item of property, plant and equipment is de recognised upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected to arise from the 

continued use of the asset. Any gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an item of property, plant and equipment is determined as the 

difference between the sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and is recognised in the profit or loss.

For transition to IND AS, the company has elected to continue with the carrying value of all of its property, plant and equipment recognised as of 

1st April 2016 (transition date) measured as per the previous GAAP and use that carrying value as its deemed cost as of the transition date.

**AMBIKA COTTON MILLS LIMITED**

Buildings    
 
 
 
 
 
30- 40 Years

Furniture & fixtures  
 
 
 
 
3 Years

Vehicles  
 
 
 
 
 
8 years

Office Equipments

**2.4 . Intangible Assets**

Intangible assets  are carried at cost less accumulated amortisation. Amortisation is recognised on a straight line basis over their estimated useful 

lives. 

**2.5 Impairment of assets**

A tangible or intangible asset is treated as impaired when the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its estimated recoverable value. Carrying 

amounts of tangible or intangible assets are reviewed at each balance sheet date to determine indications of impairment, if any, of those assets. If 

any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated and an impairment loss equal to the excess of the carrying amount 

over its recoverable value is recognised as an impairment loss. The impairment loss, if any, recognised in prior accounting period is reversed if 

there is a change in estimate of recoverable amount.

**2.6 Financial Instruments**

Financial assets and financial liabilities constitute Financial Instruments and are recognised only when the company becomes party to the 

contractual provisions of the instrument. 

On initial recognition , (i)  financial assets are  classified either at amortised cost  or  fair value through other comprehensive income ( OCI)  or 

fair value through profit or loss ( FVTPL) and (ii) financial liabilities  either  at amortised cost or  fair value through profit or loss ( FVTPL) 

On initial recognition, a financial asset or a financial liability is measured at its fair value. In the case of a financial asset or liability which is not 

categorised  at FVTPL , the financial asset or liability will be measured at its fair value plus/minus transaction cost that are directly contributed 

to the acquisition or issue of the financial asset or financial liability. 

The financial assets and liabilities are carried at FVTPL and there are no financial assets and liabilities falling under other categories.

The equity instruments are categorised at FVTPL and are measured at the end of each reporting period. 

In the case of derivatives, the contractual rights and obligations are recognised as assets or liabilities in the balance sheet. 

The financial assets are  derecognised when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset expires.

The financial liabilities are derecognises when the obligations are discharged.

**2.7 Equity Instruments**

An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of an entity after deducting all of its liabilities. Equity 

instruments issued by the entity are recognised at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.

Repurchase of the company's own equity instruments is recognised and deducted directly in equity. No gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss 

on the purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of the company's own equity instruments.

**2.8  Valuation of Inventories**

Inventories are valued at lower of cost or net realisable value after providing for obsolescence and other losses, where considered necessary. The 

costs of inventories are ascertained on weighted average method. Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of 

business, less the estimated costs of completion and the estimated costs necessary to make the sale.  

**AMBIKA COTTON MILLS LIMITED**

**st  NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 MARCH 2023**

Estimated useful lives of the intangible assets are as follows:

Technical Know how   
 
 
 
4 years

**2.9. Foreign Currency transactions:**

Foreign currency transactions are recorded at the exchange rates prevailing at the date of the transaction.

Foreign currency monetary items at the balance sheet date are reported using the closing rate.

Exchange differences arising on the settlement of monetary items or on reporting of monetary

items at rates different from those at which they were initially recorded during the year or reported in previous financial statements are 

recognized as income or expense in the year in which they arise.

Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are not retranslated.

**2.10 Recognition of revenue**

Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable. Amounts disclosed as revenue are net of returns. The company 

recognises revenue when the amount of revenue can be reliably measured, it is probable that future economic benefits will flow to the entity.

Dividend income from investments is recognised when the right to receive payment is established 

Interest income is recognized on time proportionate basis with reference to the principal outstanding and at the effective interest rate applicable.

 Export incentives are recognised when the right to receive payment/credit is established and no significant uncertainity as to measurability or 

collectability exists. 

**2.11 Borrowing Cost**

Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of qualifying assets, which are assets that necessarily take a 

substantial period of time to get ready for their intended use or sale, are added to the cost of those assets, until such time as the assets are 

substantially ready for their intended use or sale.

**2.12 Date of recording of Final Dividend declared by the Company as a liability**

Final dividend on shares are recorded as a liability on the date of approval by the shareholders at the annual general meeting and interim 

dividend are recorded as a liability on the date of declaration by the Company's Board of Directors.

**2.13 Earnings per share:**

Basic Earnings per share is calculated by dividing the Net Profit after tax attributable to the equity shareholders by the weighted average number 

of Equity Shares outstanding during the year.

**2.14 Employee Benefits:**

Employee benefits consist of provident fund and gratuity. The company's contribution to provident fund is considered as defined contribution 

plan and charged as an expense based on the amount of contribution required to be made. For defined benefit plan the company contributes to 

group gratuity scheme formulated by Life Insurance Corporation of India as demanded by the said corporation to discharge its liability on 

account of employee post employment benefits.

 

**2.15. Taxes on Income**

Income tax expense comprises current and deferred income tax.

**Current tax**

Current income tax for current and prior periods is recognised at the amount expected to be paid to or recovered from the tax authorities, using 

the tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting date. 

**AMBIKA COTTON MILLS LIMITED**

**st NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31  MARCH 2023**

**Deferred tax**

Deferred tax is recognised on temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities. Deferred tax liabilities are recognised 

for all taxable temporary differences. Deferred tax assets are recognised for all deductible temporary differences to the extent that it is probable 

that taxable profits will be available against which those deductible temporary differences can be utilised. 

Deferred tax liabilities and assets are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period in which the liability is settled or the asset 

realised, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period.

The measurement of deferred tax liabilities and assets reflects the tax consequences that would follow from the manner in which the company 

expects, at the end of the reporting period, to recover or settle the carrying amount of its assets and liabilities.

**Current and deferred tax for the year**

Current and deferred tax are recognised in profit or loss, except when they relate to items that are recognised in other comprehensive income, in 

which case, the current and deferred tax are also recognised in other comprehensive income .

**2.16 Provisions, contingent liabilities and contingent assets**

Provision is recognized when there is a present obligation as a result of a past event that probably requires an outflow of resources and a reliable 

estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. Disclosure for contingent liability is made when there is a possible obligation or a present 

obligation that may, but probably will not, require an outflow of resources. No provision is recognized or disclosure for contingent liability is 

made when there is possible obligation or a present obligation and the likelihood of outflow of resources is remote. Contingent Asset is neither 

recognized nor disclosed in the financial statements. 

**2.17 Cash Flow statement and Cash and Cash equivalents**

Cash Flows are reported using the Indirect method, whereby profit before tax is adjusted for the effects of transactions of a non-cash nature, any 

deferrals or accruals of past or future operating cash receipts or payments and items of income or expense associated with investing or financing 

cash flows. Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand and balances with banks in current accounts with necessary disclosure of cash and 

cash equivalent balances that are not available for use by the company.

**3.  Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty**

The preparation of the financial statements in conformity with Ind AS requires management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions. 

These estimates, judgments and assumptions affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the 

disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the 

period. Application of accounting policies that require critical accounting estimates involving complex and subjective judgments and the   use of 

assumptions in these financial statements have been disclosed in notes. Accounting estimates could change from period to period. Actual results 

could differ from those estimates. Appropriate changes in estimates are made as management becomes aware of changes in circumstances 

surrounding the estimates. Changes in estimates are reflected in the financial statements in the period in which changes are made and, if 

material, their effects are disclosed in the notes to the financial statements.

The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in 

which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both 

current and future periods.

Information about such estimates and judgments are included in the relevant notes together with the basis of calculation for relevant line item in 

the financial statements. Estimates and judgments are based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events 

that may have a financial impact on the company and that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances

other financial assets  carrying credit risk.

substantial current assets to pay off short term obligations arising from  working capital bank borrowings , trade payables and 

other related liabilities .
